## Overview
The Cyber Threat Sensor (CTS) provides in-depth visibility of network-based threats. Network traffic is analyzed by multiple methods based on exclusive NTT techniques and threat intelligence. 
There are two versions of the CTS with different capabilities. The version required depends on the service subscribed to.
* CTS Enhanced: Threat Detection - Enhanced (TD-E) & Managed Detection and Response (MDR) 
* CTS Standard:Security Operations Center as a Service (SOCaaS) 

Capabilities for each version are summarized in the Table 1 below.

| Capability | Enhanced | Standard |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Supported service | TD-E & MDR | SOCaaS |
| Alert and corresponding evidence data (PCAP) sent to SOC Security Analyst for investigation | x | N/A |
| Full PCAP | x | N/A |
| Alert auto-generates Security Incident Report | N/A | x |

Table 1 CTS capabilities

NTT provides specifications for 500 Mbps, 1 Gbps and 4 Gbps throughput.

| CTS throughput | Hardware deployment | Virtual deployment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 500 Mbps | x | x |
| 1 Gbps | x | x |
| 4 Gbps | x | N/A |

Table 2 Deployment alternatives


## Preparations
Build / configure a host. Bare metal is always the best choice but virtual works when no other options is available.

### Hardware specifications
NTTâ€™s CTS may be run on either virtual or hardware form factors as provisioned by the client.
The specifications varies between CTS - Enhanced and CTS - Standard. Please refer to Table 1 to identify the version that applies to the service(s) you are subscribing to.

### Supported operating systems
* Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS (x86_64): https://ubuntu.com/download/server

#### Depricated
Still supported for existing deployments but no new installations will be allowed
* CentOS7 7 minimal (x86_64): http://isoredirect.centos.org/centos/7/isos/x86_64/)

### OS installation
Install OS using default settings except for:
* Network: Configure IP address and routing for management interface
* Disk: Partition system disk according to default values. Do NOT modify data disk, leave the data disk untouched. It will be formated by the installer.

### Bring monitoring interface up
Check doc folder in this project and configure your monitoring interface accordingly

### Install the CTS
Issue the following command and follow the guide. Once completed the CTS is ready.
```console
wget -q -O install.sh https://git.io/JZmVM && sudo bash ./install.sh
```
